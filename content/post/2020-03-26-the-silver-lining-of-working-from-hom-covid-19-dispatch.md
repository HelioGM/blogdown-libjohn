I live, and now work, a half block from Duke’s east campus.  From my window perch, which now doubles as my office, I see social distance in action.  People walk, jog, and scooter down sidewalks.  On nice days I amble over to East Campus where a small multitude of walkers route around the perimeter campus wall.  These days there are more exercisers but fewer social klatches.   To the north of campus across Markham avenue where I practice working from home, managing workshops and data consultations via **Zoom is the "new normal**."  Two weeks ago, Zoom was a little used feature of my work environment while my day-to-day interactions (those data consultations and data science training workshops) were primarily done in face-to-face settings. 

As a data science librarian my work is service oriented, helping people use various digital tools or learn about digital options.  I enjoy helping people become more data savvy and digitally self-sufficient as we all move through broader and ongoing digital transitions.  As such, remote online interactions are not new to me.  Although Duke prides itself on our face-to-face campus presence, suddenly the health concerns of COVID-19 demand rethinking the feasibility of close interactions. This means we rely on existing digital tools that are not yet completely normal to us.

As the library was nearing a complete physical shutdown, I was gearing up my digital presence on Zoom.  That week, my first Zoom consultation was with a student in Key West.  I don’t know if she lives there or stayed after the official end of spring break.  What I do know is we both more fully appreciate the utility of remote consultations, even as we test the limits of digital tools.  Through a combination of Zoom, email, and Box.com we shared screens, swapped datasets and code, and had a resoundingly useful digital interaction.  

As the next days came into view I busied myself, in my work-from-home glory, by hosting more Zoom consultations, fielding questions from patrons over email, and retooling my upcoming workshops for online broadcast. Fortunately I had a head start using digital technologies already embedded in the Library.  Online, in my digital notebooks and [on my digital shelves](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/), I offer streamable recordings of previous workshops.  The associated resources for those workshops -- slide decks, datasets and code -- are shareable under creative-commons license and available on our library web sites as well as on [GitHub](https://github.com/libjohn/).  

Most of my workshops focus on promoting open-source tools that enhance or enable reproducible scholarly workflows. The applications I use are easy for our patrons to acquire because those tools are open source and free.  In the Center for Data & Visualization Sciences we promote reproducibility and transparent data management. We regularly meet scholars working with machine actionable resources. It’s these daily methods and techniques that are among the academy’s greatest assets in the crisis of science.  In this way I display and support modern analysis tools that are top-shelf alternatives to proprietary software and insular data practices.

But none of this is new.  For years, I have been able to carry out my duties in a work-from-home setting.  This may be surprising to some because we think (sometimes?  often?) of the library as a locus of physical objects and physical scholarship services.  I appreciate the library preserving the physical artifacts of scholarship.  However, I’m employed in another vital part of our vibrant Library.  I work in the part of the library that always plants a foot firmly in evolving methods, servicing scholarship enhanced by digital technologies.  

For me the library always expresses this duality:  preserving the past and operating in the shrewd present with a proficiency of modern conveniences.  Consider that my first experiences with computers include ATM machines and library catalogs -- back then all the screens were monochrome green on black.  I’ve worked at the Duke Library for more than 25 years; my first job was an Electronic Information Specialist (aka Reference Librarian) in the Pubic Documents department -- the US Government being the largest publisher of digital information, at that time.    

Now, in the days of COVID-19, we are suddenly practicing and relying on telework in real time. However, Duke and the Duke Libraries were already leaders using the digital tools of the day.  We were already an institutional subscriber to tools like Zoom.  We recorded our workshops.  We shared our datasets and code on GitHub.  We answered data questions on email and used Skype with remote patrons.  We practice [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) and open data management with open source tools such as Git, R, and Python.  Maybe we haven't stress tested these remote working concepts and tools, but arguably we had been stress testing all along.  Now, in the current moment, current practice means using our open digital work environment within our capabilities.

I feel fortunate that the medical imperative of my remote work is supported by the Libraries.  I'm very thankful Duke is poised as a leader, helping us all flatten-the-curve via social distancing while we move through novel stages of this work-from-home campaign. 

Formerly, beyond my face-to-face meetings while in my former on-site office cubicle, I often worked and listened to music through headphones.  In my new home office, né bedroom, I play music over actual speakers and chat more often with my semi-retired wife.  There’s not a lot of chatting -- I am working -- but we have lunch together and she catches me up on her doings.  We eat healthy meals.  I can cook creatively for lunch and be back at work in a fraction of the time it takes to walk to the dining hall. 

While my location has changed, the digital transitions are not particularly inventive for me.  What is difficult is the pandemic, especially for people with kids and parents in nearby spaces. It is a great concern.  While I work from home in relative ease, I think about front-line workers and people juggling critical family issues.  Those are the real challenges. Working from home is a silver lining.
