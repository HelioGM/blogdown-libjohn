<p>Last week I wrote on the eternal verities of <a href="/post/2017-08-03-rmarkdown/">R Markdown</a>. This post covers a slide presentation package in R. Xaringan slides are one of the many awesome report formats enabled by R Markdown.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> With Xaringan, incorporating slides into my analysis-to-report workflow becomes a natural and critical step in reproducible data science.</p>

<p>“Notably, you do not have to be a coder to take advantage of this approach. Xaringan slides can be authored with the same ease as with any other normal or more proprietary slide tools.”</p>

<p>First some some fun facts about presentation software and slide decks. Did you know one of the early versions of PowerPoint was released for the MS-DOS operating system?<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> If I wasn’t already a Xaringan Slides user I might wonder about the authoring interface for MS-DOS::PowerPoint. After all, if you don’t have a mouse can you even present?</p>

<p>Authoring <a href="/#presentations">my slide presentations</a> with <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/">Xaringan</a> – (pronounced <em>Share-in-gan</em>) – is easy because slides are composed in R Markdown. Since the Xaringan package is optimized for RStudio, it’s also easy to maintain versioning and sharing via git/GitHub. The output slides are actually HTML and are therefore portable. They can be hosted on a flash drive or a laptop for presentation. It’s also simple to host my slide decks on any website. Sharing a slide deck requires only a web browser, not even a webserver. I generate my slides from analysis scripts and then integrate the output and hosting – using blogdown – at my own website. No more wondering if I have a publicly accessible back-up version of my slides. (Blogdown is another wonderful innovation and I’ll post about that in the future.)</p>
<p>The editor pane and authoring method is well integrated into R and RStudio so inserting analysis and visualization – generated from R code – is amazingly simple. If I update my analysis, an output report is automatically produced. This reduces post report editing because the report is derived directly from the analysis. As such, analysis and code are part of the slide authoring process. Stock images are easy to include. In fact any slide object can be inserted with ease, just like any presenter tool. Taken as a whole this integration helps maintain continuity between analysis and the final report.</p>

<p>Visually the default slide style is spare, almost austere, but given how most slides are too cluttered <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I find this an inspiring advantage. The installed Xaringan package comes with a standard CSS stylesheet, which can be customized to suite personal needs. The whole slide deck life cycle (analysis, authoring, storing, and archiving methods) is very much inline with a tidyverse approach, thus bringing a nimble approach to reproducibility while enabling you to document your slides with literate code practices. Notably, you do not have to be a coder to take advantage of this approach. Xaringan slides can be authored with the same ease as with any other normal or more proprietary slide tools. Just spend 20 seconds learning <a href="/post/2017-08-03-rmarkdown/">R Markdown</a> and you’ll be ready to increase your RQ (“Reproducibility Quotient”) in no time.</p>
<p>After composing a few slides decks with Xaringan I was inspired to make a custom CSS stylesheet to reflect the <a href="https://styleguide.duke.edu/color-palette/">Duke color pallette</a>. I now use that CSS as my base template and modify as necessary. My customizations with Duke specific color is integrated into a special CSS with Xaringan. It’s available on <a href="https://github.com/libjohn/slide-template-dukeu">Github</a> and ripe for collaboration. Feel free to clone or fork.</p>
<p>Last points. I suspect using Xaringan Slides is far more satisfying than MS-DOS for PowerPoint ever was, especially when used within the RStudio IDE. However the two authoring systems must have some striking similarities in the way that UNIX has influenced so much of modern computing. And if you’re wondering, my mouse remains a vital and relevant partner in all my quotidian slide production rituals.
