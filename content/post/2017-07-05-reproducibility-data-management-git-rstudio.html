summary: New reproducibility workshop with git and RStudio coming in September 2017


---



<p>I am please to provide this early-announcement and philosophical musing on a future workshop coming this Fall. In this workshop we will demonstrate and provides hands-on options for quickly learning the best practical tools promoting good data hygiene.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to our <a href="http://library.duke.edu/data/news">Workshop Calendar</a> for dates and times. Or get notified through our official announcement channels like <a href="https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/info/dvs-announce">dvs-annouce</a> and<span class="citation">[ @duke_data]</span>(<a href="http://twitter.com/duke_data" class="uri">http://twitter.com/duke_data</a>) …</p>
<p>In order to best describe the goal of this new workshop let me let me back up a step. One of the newest development in my Department (<a href="http://library.duke.edu/data">DVS</a>) is the addition of two full-time experts and a <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/data/2016/09/08/datamanagement/">CLIR fellow</a> all focused on <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/data/2017/01/17/rdm_launch/">Research Data Management</a>. We, all of us – <em>I’m looking at you, Duke Research Community</em> – are lucky to have these three experts help us face the reproducibility crisis <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> more intelligently. With their help scholars can attend to a collective goal of documenting the research cycle and project life-cycle archiving. Alas this means <em>change</em> as we crawl through the tumultuous transition away from common past practice towards a more datafied future with new routines and modernized best practices.</p>
<p>As our data processing techniques continue a steady evolution we try to maintain momentum and we <em>hopefully</em> leverage reproducibility as a common good. I will admit, however, that as these occurrences transpire I occasionally worry about dark-ages phenomena which can threaten early-phase digital objects, rendering recent-past digital information obscure or invisible. The lapse of transparency seems likely as society undergoes qualitative leaps in adoptive pace of newer “publication” technologies and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Of course much of the focus on the crisis of reproducibility has to do with documenting past processes prior to a fixed publication point. To do this we must all learn to exploit newer methods as we move away from analog fixity and towards an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/726004.Everything_Is_Miscellaneous?from_search=true"><em>Everything is Miscenaneous</em></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> data-digital world, from digital ephemera to managed dataification. Adopting these new tools and methods efficiently means being exposed to and leveraging existing tools for code and data repositories (e.g. git, gitlab, and github) as well as integrating into a scholarly commons which efficiently documents the entire research cycle (e.g. OSF <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.)</p>
<p>Okay and but, in practice I sometimes find the use of the most sophisticated repository tools are confusing and even off-putting. The confusion leads capitulation through exhaustion. I may, for example, choose to use less sophisticated file replication sharing tools (e.g. <em>box</em>, <em>dropbox</em>, <em>onefile</em>) as if they are repositories. And while these file sharing tools are nice and clearly better than nothing, the truth is we can call <em>easily</em> reach a higher standard. That’s what this future workshop will promote: the practical use of best-practice repository tools which can integrate into your evolving practices.</p>
<p><strong>Our Focus</strong> will be the <strong>practical</strong> use of <em>git</em> through <em>Rstudio</em> and <em>OSF</em>. Our aim is to quickly demystify processes which are too-easily promoted but also too-often require reading tomes of the most boring and mind-numbing documentation which the gods have used as punishment for our warped sense of inconvenience.</p>
