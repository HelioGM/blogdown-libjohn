I've been creating my slide presentations (link) using the Xaringan package and I'm totaly thilled with the approach.

- reproducible
- r markdown (link to previous post)
- incorporate analysis, graphs, visualizations
- very useful presentation tools (help)
- modify the appearance with CSS
- link to slide recommendations
- Visualization is a less developed passion
