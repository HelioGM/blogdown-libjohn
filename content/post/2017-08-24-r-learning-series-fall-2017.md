**Tidyverse**  Visualization  

lingua franca of data science.[^lingua]

Earlier I blogged an upcoming Workshop on Data Mangement and Git using R/RStudio -- this is part 2 of our upcoming 5-part R Learning Series.  

Beging In September The Data & Visualization Services Department will kick-off our Fall Workshop series for 2017.  The series will offer workshops in each of our major service areas:  Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Research Data Management, Data Visualization, GIS and Mapping.  We are also offering a connected learning series within this broader framework focusing on R.  The exercises and how-to training will introduce the R programming language by exposing some of the broad R capabilities which make R a dynamic data science tool.

## Why R

R is a platform independent language which evolved out of the statistical community.  The OpenSource language has broad community adoption.  Subsequently help, resources, and innovations are typically only an internet search away.  The R ecosystem is connectional and deep.  Packages which extend R into a new area are wrapped into a common R syntax.  The depth of learning is boundless.



## Elements of the R Learning Series

1. Intro to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures
1. **Reproducibility: Data Management, Git, & RStudio**
1. Visualization in R using ggplot2
1. Mapping with R
1. Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny

## When
The DVS departmental line-up for the Fall 2017 workshop series is posted at the [Data & Visualization Services Workshops](http://library.duke.edu/data/news) page.
