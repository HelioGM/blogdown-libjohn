Recently I blogged about an upcoming workshop on Data Management and Git using R/RStudio.  That workshop will be one part of our upcoming **five-part R learning series** beginning in **September**.  In this post I want to more  formally introduce the fall 2017 R Learning Series, which began life last spring as the [R we Having Fun Yetâ€½](https://rfun.netlify.com/) series, or **RFUN**.  Moving toward the fall semester, we are morphing the series format based on feedback... 

> Beginning in September, DVS will host a 5-part learning series of workshops on R:  Intro/Tidyverse, Reproducibility/Git, Visualization/ggplot2, Mapping, and Shiny.  

Beginning In September The Data & Visualization Services (DVS) Department will kick-off our Fall Workshop series for 2017.  The series offers workshops in each of our thematic service areas:  Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Research Data Management, Data Visualization, GIS and Mapping.  *We are also offering a connected learning series within this broader series* in which we will **focus on the R programming language**.  The RFun workshops will contain demonstration, hands-on exercises, and how-to training.  Our goal is to introduce the R programming language by exposing some of the broad R capabilities.  Some people have called R the "lingua franca of data science."[^lingua] We intend to highlight some of these R capabilities that make R a dynamic data science tool.[^best_ds]  

## Why R

R is a platform independent language that evolved out of the statistical sciences and data analysis communities.  The open source language has broad community adoption, and is often touted as one of the premier data science analysis tools.  The community-based popularity of R means that help, resources, and innovations are within easy reach.  Furthermore, the R ecosystem is connectional and deep.  Packagesm, which extend R into new analysis or visualization areas, are wrapped into a common R syntax.  If we combine the depth of learning opportunities with R's extensibility, it becomes clear why R is referred to as a "Swiss army knife" of data analysis.

## The Fall 2017 R Learning Series

Our fall 2017 line-up for RFun workshops has changed a bit.  Last spring we delivered 8 informal lunch-length demonstrations on aspects of R.  ([Recordings, Learning materials and slides](https://rfun.netlify.com/2017/01/16/rfun-schedule-spring-2017/) are available.)  This fall we are transforming our series into more formal, hands-on workshops.  Each R workshops will take place on a Monday, beginning in mid-September.  Individual workshops will last two hours and the series will extend over four consecutive weeks with the fifth workshop (Shiny) taking place after a brief respite.  

1. Intro to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures (Sept. 11, Repeated Oct. 17)
1. Reproducibility: Data Management, Git, & RStudio (Sept. 18)
1. Visualization in R using ggplot2 (Sept. 25)
1. Mapping with R (Oct. 2)
1. Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny (Oct. 19)

## Registration
Dates and details are available through our [DVS Workshops Registration](http://library.duke.edu/data/news) page.  Advanced registration with a Duke NetID is required.  

## Access to Workshop Materials
Importantly, **advanced registration is not** a conduit to receiving **an annoucement** regarding recordings.  I note this here to remind people to avoid squatting on limited seating.  Squatting is unnecessary since **all workshops will be recorded**.  Workshop materials, slide presentations, and data will be **shared publicly following** the actual workshops.  See the [DVS past workshops](http://library.duke.edu/data/news/past-workshops) page for access and availability.
