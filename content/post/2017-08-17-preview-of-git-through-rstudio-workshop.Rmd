In a [previous post](/post/2017-07-05-reproducibility-data-management-git-rstudio/) I mentioned a future workshop:  *Reproducibility: Data Management, git, RStudio*.  This is the second in a five-part series of practical, hands-on workshops making up our R learning series.  The five parts include:

1. Intro to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures
1. **Reproducibility: Data Management, Git, & RStudio**
1. Visualization in R using ggplot2
1. Mapping with R
1. Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny

The goal of the second workshop is to leverage RStudio's Git orchesteration features.  We will demonstrate and using R for reproducible data science and report generation.  We believe a critical component of that reproducibility is Git's version control and we really like how RStudio has simplified Git's function by reducing the need to memorize git archane commands.

To that end we will provide a gentle introduction to promote the use of Git in developing report outputs through R.  Through this hands-on workshop users will gain practical experience foo foo foo, hands-on workshop where users unfamiliar with Git will come with a configured laptop.  away having configured their laptop to Duke's GitLab instance; 


The workshop is open to the Duke University Community (registration link, below.)  The workshop will be recorded and made available for self-paced instruction after the presentation.  The recording will be made available publiclly so there is no need to register if you're not part of the Duke Community.^[Registration will not add you to a list annoucing the recording] 

The following is a set of links previewing that workshop...

I've posted the draft resources for my portion: [Using RStudio to orchestrate Git](https://rfun.netlify.com/git/).  From that lanch page you can find a link to my slides and the hands-on portion of the discussion.  An OSF Project link will show up there eventually.

Ping me if you have thoughts or questions.  Meanwhile you can find a full list of our Fall 2017 workshop on [my Departmental webpage](http://library.duke.edu/data/news).
