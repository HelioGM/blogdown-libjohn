## New Workshop for the Fall of 2017.

I am pleased to announce [Mark Thomas](http://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/2271) and I will teach a New R workshop this fall focusing on GIS techniques in R.

Details to follow but till then a rough draft of potential topics follows.  Well, seriously, what you find below is really more of a "laundry list" than a draft.  I have too many topics to cover in a two hour session so Mark and I will have to work hard to finalize the curriculum.  

Stay tuned to our [Workshop Calendar](http://library.duke.edu/data/news) for dates and times. Or get notified through our official announcement channels like [dvs-annouce](https://lists.duke.edu/sympa/info/dvs-announce) and[ @duke_data](http://twitter.com/duke_data)  ...


1. Library packages:  `tigris`, `censusapi`, `tmap`, `sp`, `sf`, `ggmap`, `raster`, `rgdal`, `tidycensus`

2. Concepts to consider -- super rough draft

    a. Introduce geolocate and layers with `ggmap`
    b. Use of basemaps with `plot()` and `ggmap()`
    c.  Also with ggmap
    
        i. Choropleth
        i. Lines and polygons
        i. Fill polygons with data values
        
    d. Gather some census data (`censusapi` package)
    
        i. Show county boundaries for some state (RI (*small*) or NC (*local*))
        i. `qtm()` --  function for quick thematic maps.
        i. Introduce SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
        i. Get the roads layer
        i. Combine different states (or counties, whatever)
        i. Merge data with `geo_join`
        i. Thematic mapping with `tmap` -- standard choropleth with median home value
        i. interactive map with `ttm()`  (i.e. `tmap` with `leaflet`)
        i. Projection/CRS - Converting projections
        
    e. Simple features -- library(sf)
    f. `library(raster)`
    g. How to read in ESRI shapefiles: `readOGR()`
    h. Merging data attributes: `merge()`
    i. geoJSON
