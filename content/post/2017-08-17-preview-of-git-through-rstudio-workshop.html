<p>In a <a href="/post/2017-07-05-reproducibility-data-management-git-rstudio/">previous post</a> I mentioned a future workshop: <em>Reproducibility: Data Management, git, RStudio</em>. This is the second in a five-part series of practical, hands-on workshops making up our R learning series. The five parts include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Intro to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility: Data Management, Git, &amp; RStudio</strong></li>
<li>Visualization in R using ggplot2</li>
<li>Mapping with R</li>
<li>Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the second workshop is to leverage RStudio’s Git orchesteration features. We will demonstrate and using R for reproducible data science and report generation. We believe a critical component of that reproducibility is Git’s version control and we really like how RStudio has simplified Git’s function by reducing the need to memorize git archane commands.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To that end we will provide a gentle introduction to promote the use of Git in developing report outputs through R. Through this hands-on workshop users will gain practical experience foo foo foo, hands-on workshop where users unfamiliar with Git will come with a configured laptop. away having configured their laptop to Duke’s GitLab instance;</p>
<p>The workshop is open to the Duke University Community (registration link, below.) The workshop will be recorded and made available for self-paced instruction after the presentation. The recording will be made available publiclly so there is no need to register if you’re not part of the Duke Community.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>I’ve posted the draft resources for my portion: <a href="https://rfun.netlify.com/git/">Using RStudio to orchestrate Git</a>. From that lanch page you can find a link to my slides and the hands-on portion of the discussion. An OSF Project link will show up there eventually.</p>
