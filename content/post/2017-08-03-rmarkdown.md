## R Markdown is Awesome

*R Markdown is Awwwwwesoommmmmme*.  There, I said it. See, I have this nifty [new website](/).  It's produced via Blog*down* and **composed in R Markdown**.  To feed my blog section I plan on writing occasional posts such as this one.  But where do I start? (â€œBegin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely[^1]) ...  

These days I use R, a lot.  I use R Markdown to compose reports while documenting analysis. R scripts and R Notebooks are composable with R Markdown.  Using R Markdown I wrote an e-book, this website, web dashboards, and interactive quizzes.  I make slide presentations constantly.  Different R packages enable this activity and the common thread, aside from R, is R Markdown.  Initially, I was going to launch my blog with a post about Xaringan Slides.  Then I realized I need to lead with R Markdown -- duh -- because R Markdown enhances the readability and document structure for many reports.  

### Why use R Markdown

R Markdown is easy to learn and easy to use.  When used with RStudio, R Markdown will enable report derivatives while the content remains readable and reproducible.  It's a benevolent cycle:  write a document once in R Markdown, derive reports with minimal effort, maintain the whole project with readable source material. In this way you put [*literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) into practice by generating your reports from your code.  Notably, you don't need to be a coder or an analyst to benefit from using R Markdown as your document generator.  With R Markdown you can transform your content into many formats including slides, journal articles, PDF, Word files, web pages, web dashboards, web sites, dynamic quizzes, LaTex.  (*But wait, there's more. Act now and you'll get ...*)

### What is R Markdown

R Markdown is a flavor of Markdown.  Markdown is a lightweight "language" used to add structure to text.  The mark*down* goal is to simplify mark*up* languages. The resulting simplicity means the content is less cluttered and easier to read. Easier because mark*up* languages are intended to be rendered by other programs before being read. Mark*down* can still be rendered into rich text -- more visually compelling documents -- while the simplicity maintains readability and clarifies document structure.  Additionally, markdown is a more compellingly [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) practice which yields quick report production and easy format transformations.

### Learn R Markdown in 20 seconds

Learning R Markdown is quick and painless.  Glance at [this summary example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example) and you've practically learned the whole spec.  You may have noticed I linked to a markdown example.  The good folks at [RStudio](//rstudio.com) have seen the  wisdom of markdown and incorporated the spec with minor tweaks.  The few extra features of R Markdown are useful while the differences in the two "languages" are so minimal that learning one is essentially learning the other.  Learn more [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) ([*cheatsheet*](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)) and make your data science reports dynamic and reproducible.

Now you know.  In future blog posts I will describe other packages and report tools, many composed via R Markdown.  Xaringan slides is coming soon.  Stay tuned...
