APIs are a great way to gather information for analysis.  R can help you interact with an API.  

In this Hand's on presentation given to the 
[Research Computing Symposium (2017)](https://rc.duke.edu/symposium-2017/),
 partipants use R to gather movie data from the OMDB API.  In part 2, participants 
 access the API of Fire and Ice.
