This workshop will introduce some general data management strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work. You will also learn through hands-on exercises how to harness two specific tools, git and RStudio, to support the execution of more reproducible research projects. Git is a powerful version control system and RStudio is an open-source statistical software program. No previous experience with Git or R is required for this workshop. "
